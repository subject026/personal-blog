There are many different types of cheese. There are also many different types of people. Different people like different types of cheese. This post aims to give you an overview of people and cheese preference.

There are soft cheeses and hard cheeses, thick cheeses and thin cheeses, big cheeses and small cheeses, cheap cheeses and expensive cheeses. There are many other types of cheese.

Different people often like different types of cheese. Some people like large soft cheeses while others prefer small hard cheeses. Some like a cheap thick cheese, others an expensive thin cheese. Some people don't like cheese at all. Etc.

Often a persons cheese preference comes down to a mixture of genetics and the environment they grew up in. As a person doesn't get to choose either of these things I try not to judge people on their cheese preference. You might feel differently.
